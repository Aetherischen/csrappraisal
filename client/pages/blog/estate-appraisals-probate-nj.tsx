            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              New Jersey is one of the few states that still imposes an
              inheritance tax, which applies to property transferred to certain
              beneficiaries. The tax rates and exemptions depend on the
              relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary:

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Accurate property valuation is crucial because the inheritance tax
              is calculated based on the fair market value of assets transferred
              to each beneficiary. Overvaluation leads to unnecessary tax
              payments, while undervaluation can result in penalties and
              interest.

              Federal Estate Tax Considerations
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              For 2024, the federal estate tax exemption is $13.61 million per
              individual ($27.22 million for married couples). While most New
              Jersey estates fall below this threshold, those that exceed it
              must file Form 706 and provide professional appraisals for all
              real estate holdings.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The primary appraisal required for estate purposes establishes the
              fair market value of real property as of the date of death. This
              valuation serves multiple purposes:

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              For federal estate tax purposes, executors may elect to value
              assets six months after the date of death if doing so reduces the
              overall estate tax liability. This election requires careful
              consideration and professional guidance, as it applies to all
              estate assets, not just real estate.

              When real estate is owned jointly or passes to multiple

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Estate appraisals in New Jersey require careful attention to state
              and federal requirements, local market conditions, and family
              dynamics. The complexity of inheritance tax laws, combined with
              unique property characteristics throughout the state, demands
              professional expertise and thorough documentation.

              The Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate increases since
              March 2022 have fundamentally altered the New Jersey real estate
              landscape. Based on our analysis of over 1,800 appraisals
              completed in 2024 and extensive market research, we examine how
              rising borrowing costs are reshaping property values, buyer
              behavior, and market dynamics across the Garden State.

              The Interest Rate Environment: A Historical Perspective
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              To understand the current market's impact, it's essential to
              examine the dramatic shift in borrowing costs. From March 2022 to
              December 2024, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate
              from near-zero to 5.25-5.50%, the highest level in over two
              decades.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              This monetary policy shift directly translated to mortgage rate
              increases that have reshaped affordability calculations across New
              Jersey. A borrower purchasing a $500,000 home with a 20% down
              payment now faces monthly payments approximately $1,200 higher
              than they would have in early 2022.

              Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The interest rate environment has fundamentally reshaped New
              Jersey's real estate market, creating winners and losers while
              establishing new equilibrium points for pricing and activity
              levels. While affordability has declined significantly for
              financed buyers, cash purchasers and existing homeowners with
              low-rate mortgages have maintained advantages.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The market's resilience, particularly in premium segments,
              demonstrates the enduring appeal of New Jersey's location,
              employment opportunities, and quality of life. However, the
              bifurcation between cash and financed buyers represents a
              structural shift that may persist even as rates eventually
              decline.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              For all market participants, understanding these dynamics and
              their implications for property values is crucial for making
              informed decisions. As the market continues to evolve, working
              with experienced professionals who understand both local market
              conditions and broader economic trends becomes increasingly
              important for successful real estate transactions.

                      USPAP is a set of standards and ethics rules established
                      by The Appraisal Foundation that governs the development
                      and communication of real estate appraisals. Every
                      licensed appraiser in New Jersey must comply with these

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              USPAP was first adopted in 1987 and has since become the
              nationally recognized standard for professional appraisal
              practice. The standards are updated every two years to reflect
              changes in the profession and marketplace. For New Jersey property
              owners, this means any appraisal you receive—whether for a
              mortgage, refinance, estate planning, or legal purposes—must meet
              these rigorous standards.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              For New Jersey property owners, this means your appraiser should
              have specific experience with your property type, location, and
              local market conditions. For example, an appraiser valuing a
              historic property in Princeton should understand historic property
              valuation, while someone appraising a Shore home should understand
              coastal market dynamics.

              Scope of Work
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              USPAP requires appraisers to determine the appropriate scope of
              work for each assignment. The scope of work must be sufficient to
              produce credible assignment results. This includes:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <li>The extent of property inspection required</li>
              <li>The type and extent of data research and analysis</li>
              <li>The type and extent of valuation approaches to consider</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Your New Jersey appraiser should explain their scope of work and
              how it's appropriate for your specific assignment. For a refinance
              appraisal, this might include a full interior and exterior
              inspection, while a estate appraisal might require additional
              research into market conditions at a specific date.

            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              USPAP requires appraisers to maintain a workfile for each
              appraisal for a minimum of five years. This workfile must contain:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <li>

              USPAP standards protect both appraisers and property owners by
              ensuring consistent, ethical, and competent appraisal practice.
              For New Jersey property owners, understanding these standards
              helps you know what to expect from the appraisal process and
              ensures you receive the reliable, professional service you
              deserve.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              When you work with a USPAP-compliant appraiser, you can be
              confident that your property valuation follows nationally
              recognized standards for professionalism, ethics, and technical
              competency. This protects your interests whether you're buying,
              selling, refinancing, or dealing with legal matters involving your
              New Jersey property.
